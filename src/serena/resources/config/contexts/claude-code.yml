  CLI coding agent context. File ops, edits, reads, and shell are handled by your internal tools.
  Prioritize Serena's symbolic tools for token-efficient code exploration. Avoid reading entire files.

  - replace_content
  - initial_instructions
  - onboarding
  - check_onboarding_performed

# whether to assume that Serena shall only work on a single project in this context (provided that a project is given
# when Serena is started).
# If set to true and a project is provided at startup, the set of tools is limited to those required by the project's
# concrete configuration, and other tools are excluded completely, allowing the set of tools to be minimal.
# Tools explicitly disabled by the project will not be available at all.
# The `activate_project` tool is always disabled in this case, as project switching cannot be allowed.
